      "notes": "The CSBS Community Bank Sentiment Index captures on a quarterly basis what community bankers nationwide think about future business and economic conditions over the next 12 months. The composite index is created from survey responses to seven questions which are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase and then adding 100. When the share of community banks reporting an increase exceeds the share of community banks reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than 100, suggesting expansion and positive sentiment. If the share of community banks reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below 100, suggesting contraction and negative sentiment. An index will be 100 when the number of community banks reporting an increase is equal to the number of community banks reporting a decrease.
